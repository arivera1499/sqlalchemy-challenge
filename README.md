# sqlalchemy-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I relied very heavily on outside resources especially chatgpt when it came to explaining and finding the methods and functions necessary for this diffiuclt assignment. 

-The final file with code submitted was the finish product of the startcode that was given for us to use as well as the python file which will run flask on a webbrowser to query results in json format 

-I also received assistance from a couple of peers when theorizing how to handle certain aspects of the project especially during part 2.
